Most questions asked  aimed at testing us on our logical reasoning abilities and quantitative  aptitude. There were a few English proficiency-testing questions as well, if I  remember correctly Round 2 - Technical Interview   After introductions, I was actually given two consulting-type case  questions. The first was a guesstimate and the second was a profitability  question. These are quite simple in level and resemble the kind asked in  preliminary interview rounds for the different consulting clubs on campus.  Basic questions pertaining to CS F212 - Database Systems were also asked  in my interview, but I was not asked a lot of IT-based questions. I suspect  that this was because I am in CS myself, so be prepared to be tested on  topics that might slightly be out of your depth.

As this was the first time that DMI Finance hired  from BITS, I did not really know what else to prepare for the interview with.  Words of advice -   I observed that prior internship experience in data analytics had been  viewed very positively by my interviewers. So, if this is an offer you would  like to pursue, you could certainly try obtaining some internship experience  either off-campus or via PS-1 in data analytics.  Additionally, be sure to stay very comfortable with Excel and SQL, especially  if you aren’t from CS, as that only increases your likelihood of being asked  questions to test your proficiency in them. While not a lot of my coursework was very relevant to the role, the CS F212 -  Database Systems course is incredibly important. Do not miss out on  learning the core concepts from this course if you are not in A7 yourself, as  that only increases your likelihood of being asked questions pertaining to  these topics.

However, I  attribute that to my Finance minor as well as my prior work experience. I  was doing FIN F345 - Derivatives and Risk Management at the time, and  had also mentioned that on my resume. So, the interviewer immediately  began asking me basic questions around the same. They then spent around  20 min discussing my work at WorldQuant as an independent research  consultant.

I  was also asked about my extracurriculars and other HR questions. Personal Experience Sources of preparation -   I just brushed upon the basics of my 2nd year CDCs. I think that staying  strong in my fundamentals did come in handy during the interview process. Words of advice -   It felt like they were trying to check my ability to stay composed and  confident in what I was saying. So, I would suggest everyone to stay  confident and to keep a calm head about them. Additionally, I was also  asked about my PoRs, so, be sure to be well-versed in your resume. So long  as you are able to justify whatever you have mentioned, there should be no  problems.'},\n",

The technical test would  especially require that you revise the core concepts taught in your  respective second-year CDCs (BE only). Knowledge of some basic  formulae would be helpful.

Due to my dual degree being in economics, I was first asked  about the usage of statistics in ML. It seemed like they were searching for  keywords in my answer and would immediately move on from them when  found. They tested me on a range of topics, from linear regression to time  series. Then they started asking questions about ML in a similar fashion, with again  a range of topics, from regression techniques to handling datasets.  Regarding the latter, they gave me a certain type of data and specified  some features and values and asked me how I would go about analysing it  to arrive at a certain result.

Personal Experiences Words of Advice -  One thing that I would suggest is to approach any interview, not just this,  with a carefree, confident, and calm mindset. Day 0 and Day 1 interviews  especially have very high competition, but the truth is that this stress  inevitably shall reflect in your performance. The interviewers are all likely  experienced, so its very easy for them to catch onto your stress as well.

Words of Advice -   Practice answers to the HR questions in advance, as the interview is only for  15-20 min, so it isn’t very efficient for your technical segment if you take  too much time in the HR segment.  Additionally, start competitive coding at least in your 2-2 if not earlier,  because you will need all this time to be able to land your dream SI offer.  Moreover, you can also correlate with concepts being taught in your  courses, which is convenient. Round 2 - Technical and HR Interview  This round started with introductions and some basic HR questions around  the company and my interest. Then we began with the technical segment,  which started by them asking for at least 2 programming languages that I  was comfortable with. When I stated my comfort with C++ and Python, they  started asking some basic questions around those. After this, I was asked  some MySQL questions, like, they gave me a complicated query and asked  which of these the compiler would compile first.

Personal Experiences Sources of preparation -   I used YouTube to grasp the basics of DSA, DBS, OOP and DiSCo. I don’t  particularly think I required a lot of extra preparation for this role.

Words of Advice -   This is a very spontaneous recruitment process, so it would serve you well  to not overthink at any step. Be sure to show the recruiters your dedication  and your personality at every step, as they too are looking for all-rounders  and future leaders via this programme.  Also, be very thorough with your resume and what is mentioned in it,  especially because that is what will determine the primary line of  questioning in your interview rounds.

After this, I took a directed approach towards my preparation, but I am sure  that I would have done far better had I started earlier.

Even the questions asked  were very basic, such as explaining my work in a team or the principles/tech  stacks used in a project. The HR segment too had very standard questions, pertaining to my  background, hobbies, motivation and interests. Personal Experiences Sources of preparation -   I primarily worked on problem-solving with Leetcode and TakeYouForward.  To revise concepts, I used Striver’s SDE Sheet.  Words of Advice -   With respect to the interview rounds, these are entirely on the basis of your  resume, so, be very thorough with it. Do not try to misrepresent facts or  figures in your resume, those will almost definitely be called out and treated  like a red flag.  In general though, please remember to keep your head up and persevere  regardless of the rejections you face. This is an incredibly competitive  procedure, especially for SWE/SDE roles, so be sure to stay consistent with  your preparations with it.

Thus, I think my PS-I at William  O’Neal was very relevant and was viewed favourably.  Looking back, the first thing I would suggest you to do is to consistently pay  attention to and prioritise your academics and your CGPA. Besides that, it’s  always a good idea to start competitive programming as early as possible.

They started by asking me about my resume and projects. Following this, we got to the DSA segment. We started with a discussion on sorting algorithms, to great detail. This is not likely to be covered by students when they approach SI preparation with Leetcode, but it was covered by the CS F211 - Data Structures and Algorithms course. Even after that, we had a very in- depth discussion about quick sort and merge sort. Round 4 - CS Fundamental Interviews We started with a detailed discussion about my PS-I in Persistent Systems, where I had worked on a project with Federated Learning and Computer Vision. Coincidentally, my interviewer also had previously worked on a project with the intersection of these two subjects. Thus, my interview primarily took this tangent.\n",
